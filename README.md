# Books and MOOCs
[Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) Made by Princeton University

# Analysis of Algorithms
Algorithm complexity is something designed to compare two algorithms at the idea level â€” ignoring low-level details such as the implementation programming language, the hardware the algorithm runs on, or the instruction set of the given CPU.
